# Unifi-Backup-Script-Selenium
Backup script for Unifi OS and network settings using Selenium

First time using selenium so if I'm doing something stupid that's probably why

# How to use
Follow the example_sites.py file on how to create list of UnifiBackupSettings

Once this is created, run `python unifi_backup.py` and follow instructions in command prompt
